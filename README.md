# PA_Architecture
PA Architecture is a backronym where PA stands for PA Architecture, i just did this to see if I could make something like this.

It's got a bug where it can't fetch from more than cacheline 0 in the instruction cache.
I've shelved the project as i built it to see if I could and not i'm moving onto another project.
