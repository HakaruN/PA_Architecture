# PA_Architecture
Processor Architecture for my masters. PA Architecture is a backronym where PA stands for PA Architecture. NOTE: Documentation is coming at some point in the future, when things stop changing so quick.
So this is basically a fancy microcontroller wher i cba making a compiler for or GPIO pins.
It's also got a bug where it can't fetch from more than cacheline 0 in the instruction cache.
I've shelved the project as i built it to see if I could and not i'm moving onto another project.
